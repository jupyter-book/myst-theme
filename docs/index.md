# MyST Theme Documentation

This is a simple documentation site to demonstrate the functionality of the MyST Theme infrastructure.
For now, it is a barebones site meant to help preview functionality.
See [jupyter-book/myst-theme#391](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/391) for a broader plan for this documentation.
