# Add documentation

We have a small demo documentation site in `docs/` to provide guidance for how to use and develop the MyST react themes.

## Adding minimal documentation

As you add new features, document some basic information for others to use them.
Add a new section (or a page, if it's a big change) with at least:

- One sentence describing of the feature.
- One sentence describing its value and when to use it.
- A few bullet points describing how to use it and expected behavior.

## Documenting here vs. in mystmd.org or Jupyter Book

Currently much of the documentation for the myst-theme is in the [mystmd guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/website-templates).

We are considering moving all of that documentation to the `myst-theme` repository so they are in one place. Follow this issue for details:
