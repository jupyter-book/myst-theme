# `myst-theme`: A Tale of Two Themes

Welcome to the `myst-theme` documentation.

`myst-theme` is a package that contains two web themes for https://mystmd.org, namely `book-theme` and `article-theme`.

## Quickstart

If you are a developer interested in the React components provided with these web themes, or how to style an existing website, please refer to our [React component documentation](/components).

Otherwise, this development guide should help you better understand what the themes are, how to use them, and how to contribute to their development.
