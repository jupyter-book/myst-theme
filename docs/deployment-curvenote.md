description: Deploy your MyST site to Curvenote

Curvenote provides a free service to host your MyST sites with an up-to-date theme ([deployment documentation](https://github.com/curvenote/action-myst-publish) for MyST sites). The websites are hosted on a `curve.space` subdomain with your username or a [custom domain](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/custom-domains). To configure the domain(s) add them to your site configuration:

```yaml
site:
  domains:
    - username.curve.space
```

You can then deploy the site using:

```bash
curvenote deploy
```

You can also deploy from a GitHub action, which will build your site and then deploy it to Curvenote.

ðŸ›  In the root of your git repository run `myst init --gh-curvenote`

The command will ask you questions about which branch to deploy from (e.g. `main`) and the name of the GitHub Action (e.g. `deploy.yml`). It will then create a GitHub Action[^actions] that will run next time you push your code to the main branch you specified. Ensure that you including setting up your `CURVENOTE_TOKEN` which can be created from your Curvenote profile.

You can use GitHub actions to build and deploy your site automatically when you merge new documents, for example.

See the documentation for the action, including setting up your `CURVENOTE_TOKEN`:\
https://github.com/curvenote/action-myst-publish

```yaml
name: deploy-myst-site
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy ðŸš€
        uses: curvenote/action-myst-publish@v1
        env:
          CURVENOTE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CURVENOTE_TOKEN }}
```
