`@myst-theme` is a set of open-source, community-driven components designed for scientific communication that are designed to work with [myst.tools](https://myst.tools), which includes a powerful authoring framework that supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, reports and journals articles.

## Components

The components in this repository are designed to support many different themes in the MyST ecosystem. Components are mostly focused on how to turn MyST into react-components (e.g. admonitions, links, and cross-references).

## UI-Providers

The library also has a number of UI-providers that help coordinate interactions between components (e.g. cross-reference look ups, references, and theme components). Links require special attention, and we have gone with an approach to provide this at the "theme" level. For example, in `nextjs` or `remix` there are often special links that the frameworks provide to accelerate page-loading based on `prefetch`. That same link in `JupyterLab` requires a very different interaction (e.g. open a tab with another notebook). By default, links are just a simple `<a>` HTML component.

We can also use these components in this documentation, which is going to be great. 🚀
