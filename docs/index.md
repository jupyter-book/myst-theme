# MyST Theme Documentation

This is a simple documentation site to demonstrate the functionality of the MyST Theme infrastructure.
It is a barebones site meant to help preview functionality and support development.

See [the MyST theme user guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/website-templates) for documentation about how to use this theme infrastructure.

See [jupyter-book/myst-theme#391](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/391) for a broader plan for this documentation.
