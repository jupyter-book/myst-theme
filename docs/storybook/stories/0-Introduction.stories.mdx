`@myst-theme` is a set of open-source, community-driven components designed for scientific communication that are designed to work with [mystmd.org](https://mystmd.org), which includes a powerful authoring framework that supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, reports and journals articles.

## Components

The components in this repository are designed to support many different themes in the MyST ecosystem. Components are mostly focused on how to turn MyST into react-components (e.g. admonitions, links, and cross-references).

## UI-Providers

The library also has a number of UI-providers that help coordinate interactions between components (e.g. cross-reference look ups, references, and theme components). Links require special attention, and we have gone with an approach to provide this at the "theme" level. For example, in `nextjs` or `remix` there are often special links that the frameworks provide to accelerate page-loading based on `prefetch`. That same link in `JupyterLab` requires a very different interaction (e.g. open a tab with another notebook). By default, links are just a simple `<a>` HTML component.

We can also use these components in this documentation, which is going to be great. ðŸš€

## Using `MyST` Component

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@myst-theme/providers';
import { MyST, DEFAULT_RENDERERS } from 'myst-to-react';

function MyComponent({ node }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider renderers={DEFAULT_RENDERERS}>
      <MyST ast={node.children} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

export const { text, abbreviation } = DEFAULT_RENDERERS;

export const Template = (args) => (
  <ThemeProvider renderers={{ text, abbreviation }}>
    <MyST ast={JSON.parse(args.ast)} />
  </ThemeProvider>
);

This example creates an abbreviation with MyST, using a simple AST node.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story
    inline
    name="Simple MyST Demo from AST"
    args={{
      ast: `{ "type": "abbreviation", "title": "Markedly Structured Text", "children": [{ "type": "text", "value": "MyST" }] }`,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
